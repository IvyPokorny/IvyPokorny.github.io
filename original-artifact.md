# Artifact Explanation

The purpose of selecting artifacts for improvement is to showcase in three different areas, my abilities in Computer Science. 

For a more detailed description of the artifact can be found here:  [Original Artifact](https://ivypokorny.github.io/original-artifact)

Additionally, the original code for the artifact can be found here: [GitHub Stock't](https://github.com/IvyPokorny/Stock-t_2) or downloaded here: [Stock't ZIP](Stock't_IvyPokorny_Original.zip)

For the CS-499 Capstone Project I was asked to select one or more artifacts for use in the following categories:

*   Software Engineering and Design
*   Algorithms and Data Strucutres
*   Databases

For my artifacts I selected a single previous course's final project and used the three categories to improve it.

The artifact selected for this course is Stock't, an application developed in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming, aimed at streamlining inventory management for flower shops. This app addresses critical user needs, including low stock alerts, easy inventory tracking, and efficient communication of inventory levels through SMS notifications. Users can enter and modify inventory information directly on their phones, adjusting counts as products are sold or lost. Additionally, the app notifies users when any product falls below a stock threshold of 50 units, ensuring they remain informed about inventory status. This project not only highlights my technical skills but also reflects my commitment to creating user-centric solutions that enhance operational efficiency. This project includes multiple flows for user interaction. There is a Login and a Signup screen completely integrated into a User Database for logging in. The Home screen displays simple item analytics and allows users to navigate further. The Items screen allows users to Delete, or adjust Quantity in the Inventory Database. It also allows the user to Add Items on a separate screen.

The improvements are as follows:

**Software Engineering and Design**: [Stock Infographic](https://ivypokorny.github.io/enhancements#software-engineering-and-design)

**Algorithms and Data Strucutres**: [Undo & Redo Stack](https://ivypokorny.github.io/enhancements#algorithms-and-data-structures)

**Databases**: [Stock Transaction History Database](https://ivypokorny.github.io/enhancements#databases)
