# Introduction

## About Me
As a recent graduate, I am actively seeking employment and am excited to share my ePortfolio. Through various projects that encompass software engineering, algorithms, data structures, database management, and security, I have gained a solid understanding of core computer science principles and practices.

This ePortfolio showcases my technical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and dedication to user-centered design. Within this professional self-assessment, I will highlight my strengths in team collaboration, communication, technical expertise, and adherence to security best practices. It also provides a comprehensive overview of how my projects collectively demonstrate my readiness to make a meaningful contribution to the industry.

## List Of Projects + summaries
Here are some of the notable projects I completed for my program.

Inventory App -  This app is designed to streamline inventory management for flower shops, focusing on essential user needs like low stock alerts, straightforward inventory tracking, and efficient communication about inventory levels. Tailored for flower shop owners and managers, it simplifies the inventory process and enhances the user experience by enabling easy monitoring of stock levels and timely alerts. This ensures that users are always informed about their inventory. It was developed using Android Studio.

3D graphics class - I created realistic, interactive, three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. I also developed fully formed graphic applications that met project requirements. 

Intelligent Agent - 

Assembly Code - 

Smart thermostat - The Smart Thermostat project focused on creating a prototype to monitor and control room temperatures. The goal was to design a reliable, user-friendly device that sends temperature data to the fictional server software, SysTec, via Wi-Fi. My strengths included effectively implementing state machine logic for managing heating, cooling, and off modes, ensuring smooth functionality and easier debugging. I also integrated various peripherals, like a temperature sensor and LCD display, to enhance responsiveness and user experience. While pleased with the implementation, I recognize the need to optimize the code for efficiency, particularly by refactoring sections to reduce complexity and improve performance.

Pet hotel java - For this project, I developed the backend of a pet hotel management system, focusing on critical processes like pet intake and checkout. Leveraging Java’s object-oriented principles, I crafted a scalable solution. Comprehensive testing and debugging were essential to validate the system’s operations.

Travel website -  As part of this project, I went through the full software development lifecycle to update an existing travel website and enhance its personalization capabilities for users. The key phases included: Requirements Gathering, Design and Architecture, modularity and maintainability, Development and Testing, Deployment and Maintenance. Throughout the project, I followed industry-standard software development methodologies to ensure the timely delivery of a high-quality, user-centric travel website that meets the modern requirements of the target audience.
