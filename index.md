# Professional Assessment

## Introduction
Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, I have cultivated a diverse skill set that positions me as a strong candidate in the field. The coursework, coupled with the development of my ePortfolio, has allowed me to showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals, and prepare to excel in the dynamic world of technology. By completing projects that integrate software engineering, algorithms, data structures, database management, and security, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles and practices.

The ePortfolio represents the culmination of my technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and commitment to user-centered design. My enhancements to **Stock’t**, an inventory management application for flower shops, exemplify my ability to design and deliver robust computing solutions while addressing real-world challenges. This professional self-assessment will highlight my strengths in team collaboration, stakeholder communication, technical proficiency, and adherence to security best practices. It will also provide an overview of how my artifacts collectively demonstrate my readiness to contribute to the industry.

## Strengths in Core Competencies
### Collaborative Environments and Teamwork
In the Computer Science program, I honed my ability to build collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to make informed decisions. For example, in my coursework, CS320 Software Development LifeCycles I regularly participated in peer reviews, and group discussions. I nearly every class I have participated in group discussions. In this course the narratives and code review were crucial in getting feedback into organizational decisions. Without the feedback from those assignments, the enhancments would likely have been insufficient or misalligned to the requirements. These experiences taught me how to effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, fostering mutual understanding and collaboration.

The iterative development process for Stock’t exemplifies this strength. During CS 360 where the artifact was originally created I incorporated user feedback from co-workers at a flower shop to refine the app's features, such as the low-stock alert system. The enhancments made during this course included graphing functionality. This iterative approach not only improved the app's usability but also demonstrated my ability to work collaboratively with end-users to meet their needs.

### Communication with Stakeholders
The ability to deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications is critical in the field of computer science. My ePortfolio highlights this strength through clear documentation, detailed narratives, and visual representations of technical concepts. For example, the implementation of an analytics dashboard in Stock’t is accompanied by user-friendly graphs and labels, making it easier for stakeholders to interpret inventory trends.

In conversation with the owner of the flower-shop I was also able to flesh out more features that she felt would be important in an inventory app. These added features showcase my ability to adapt communications to specific audiences, ensuring that technical solutions are accessible and actionable.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
The enhancement of Stock’t with undo/redo functionality is a testament to my proficiency in algorithms and data structures. By leveraging stack data structures, I implemented a system that allows users to revert or repeat inventory changes seamlessly. This feature demonstrates my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve complex problems while adhering to algorithmic principles.

Further, the implementation of item IDs in the undo/redo stack highlights my attention to detail and commitment to efficient data management. This enhancement not only improves the app's functionality but also showcases my ability to think critically about design trade-offs and implement solutions that deliver value.

### Software Engineering and Databases
My enhancements to Stock’t reflect my strengths in software engineering and database management. The addition of a comprehensive history database enables users to track inventory changes over time, providing valuable insights into sales patterns and operational bottlenecks. This database includes fields such as item IDs, quantity changes, timestamps, and adjustment reasons, demonstrating my ability to design scalable and user-focused database solutions. Additionally, graphs have been implemented that are engineered to showcase valuable information in an effective, communicative, and readable format.

Additionally, the use of parameterized SQLite queries throughout the app ensures that the database is secure and resistant to SQL injection attacks. These practices reflect my commitment to adhering to industry standards and delivering high-quality software solutions.

### Security Mindset
Security has been a cornerstone of my work throughout the program. For example, I implemented two critical security features in Stock’t: password hashing and password complexity requirements. By hashing passwords before storing them in the database, I ensured that plaintext credentials were never exposed, enhancing the app's security. The password complexity requirements further mitigate vulnerabilities by encouraging users to create stronger passwords.

I also prioritized secure coding practices, such as using parameterized queries, to prevent SQL injection attacks. These measures demonstrate my ability to anticipate adversarial exploits and design software that protects user data and resources. Some of these queries were included in the original artifact, demonstrating a core security principle: Security should be considered from the very beginning.
