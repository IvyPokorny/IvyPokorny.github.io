## Original Artifacts

For a more detailed description of the artifact can be found here:  [Original Artifact](https://ivypokorny.github.io/original-artifact)

Additionally, the original code for the artifact can be found here: [GitHub Stock't](https://github.com/IvyPokorny/Stock-t_2) or downloaded here: [Stock't ZIP](Stock't_IvyPokorny_Original.zip)

For the CS-499 Capstone Project I was asked to select one or more artifacts for use in the following categories:

*   Software Engineering and Design
*   Algorithms and Data Strucutres
*   Databases

For my artifacts I selected a single previous course's final project and used the three categories to improve it.

# Write a short description here

The improvements are as follows:

**Software Engineering and Design**: [Stock Infographic](https://ivypokorny.github.io/enhancements#software-engineering-and-design)

**Algorithms and Data Strucutres**: [Undo & Redo Stack](https://ivypokorny.github.io/enhancements#algorithms-and-data-structures)

**Databases**: [Stock Transaction History Database](https://ivypokorny.github.io/enhancements#databases)
