# Enhancements

##   Software Engineering and Design

For this category I have implemented a Inventory display graph which colors the items in the inventory by category to allow the user to check stock counts quickly and easily. The graph supports zooming in and out as well as swapping between total count and total value. The home page also supports a list of low stock items, the name of the last item that had it's count adjusted, and a total count of how many unique items there are and how many there are total.

##   Algorithms and Data Strucutres

For this category, the improvement made allows the user to enter the history screen, which implements two stacks to undo and redo adjustments made to the inventory. This includes creation, deletion, and count adjustment. This allows simple and easy undo/redo for any mistakes made.

##   Databases

This category involved the creation of a new SQLite database in order to add the ability to track and graph items sold. The new database tracks any count adjustments made to the inventory then the graph displays all of these individual adjustments as well as the date and time they were made. In addition. this enhancement includes proper security standards for hashing passwords in the User database as well as requiring users create sufficiently complex password.
