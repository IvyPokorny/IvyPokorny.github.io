# Projects Highlighted 

These are the projects I'll be showcasing today:

### Inventory App:
This app is designed to streamline inventory management for flower shops, addressing key user needs such as low stock alerts and straightforward tracking. It enhances the user experience through easy monitoring and timely notifications.

Objective: Leverage best practices in mobile application development by implementing user-centered design principles and industry standards to create a fully functional mobile application. The app features a home screen displaying current inventory levels, an inventory tracking system for adding and updating items, and SMS notifications for low stock alerts. User feedback was integral to the design process, resulting in intuitive navigation.

Key Features:
    Adding/removing items
    Adjusting quantities
    Low stock notifications
    User authentication
    
Technology used: Android Studio

### 3D Graphics Class:
I created realistic, interactive 3D objects using application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices, resulting in fully realized graphic applications that met all project requirements.
Objective: Generate accurate representations of 3D objects and create an interactive graphics application that responds to input devices. In this case, I used a picture of my husband and I from vacation as the goal in this project.
Technologies used: OpenGL, C++.

### Intelligent Agent:
In this project, I developed an intelligent pirate agent that navigates a maze to locate treasure using reinforcement learning techniques. I began with a provided codebase, which included the foundational structure for the maze and basic agent functionalities. My contributions involved implementing deep Q-learning algorithms using neural networks, enhancing the agent’s ability to learn optimal paths through exploration and exploitation.

Key tasks included creating the Q-learning algorithm, designing the neural network architecture, and developing the training process. I coded features such as experience replay, action selection based on Q-values, and loss computation for model training. Additionally, I integrated secure coding practices and automated testing within the CI/CD pipeline to ensure robustness and implemented continuous testing to guarantee that the agent learned effectively and efficiently.

Objective: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that efficiently navigates a maze and optimizes pathfinding through advanced algorithmic design and evaluation of complex data structures.
Technologies used: Python, Jupyter Notebook

### Assembly Code:
In this project, I learned to analyze systems and software to understand their design, architecture, and functionality. This practice involved deconstructing the code to extract knowledge and recreate it without access to the original design documents. I focused on decoding legacy code by compiling and decompiling, converting it from assembly to C++ and vice versa.
Objective: Utilize fundamental reverse engineering techniques while reviewing common security issues identified through this process.  
Technologies used:Jupyter Notebook, VS Code.

### Smart Thermostat:
The Smart Thermostat project aimed to develop a prototype for monitoring and controlling room temperature. The primary goal was to create a reliable and user-friendly device that transmits temperature data to the server software of the fictional company SysTec via Wi-Fi, marking a significant step into the smart home market.

A key strength in this project was implementing state machine logic for managing heating, cooling, and off modes, which allowed for smooth functionality and easier debugging. I also integrated peripherals, including a temperature sensor and LCD display, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly system.

Objective: Develop interface software that controls hardware components, analyze hardware architecture design impacts on application performance, and recommend emerging systems architectures based on business needs.
Technologies used: Raspberry Pi 5, GPIO library, Python.

### Pet Hotel Java:
The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard is an interactive web application that provides insights into animal rescue data. Users can filter information by rescue types, displaying it in a user-friendly format. Key features include a data table, pie chart visualization of preferred breeds, and an interactive map showing animal locations. Additionally, I developed the backend, focusing on pet intake and checkout processes using Java’s object-oriented principles.

Required Functionality:
    Data Table: Lists animals with details such as breed, sex, and age.
    Filtering Options: Allows users to filter data by various rescue types (e.g., Water Rescue, Mountain Rescue).
    Pie Chart Visualization: Displays the distribution of preferred animal breeds based on user selections.
    Interactive Map: Shows the locations of selected animals, providing a geographical context.

Objective: Create a management system facilitating seamless operations.
Technologies used: MongoDB, Python libraries; pandas & Dash 

### Travel Website:
This full-stack web application serves both customer and administrative functions, featuring secure login authentication for the admin interface. It showcases the integration of frontend technologies with a robust backend, creating a seamless platform for booking travel packages and managing customer data. The admin side was developed as a single-page-application, and the backend uses NoSQL MongoDB database.
required functionality;
    User Authentication
    Customer booking system
    Data Management
    Travel package Management (Admin Side)
    Data interchange

Objective: Design the architecture of a web application, build the application using frameworks, and develop and integrate a database for functionality and responsiveness.
Technologies used: Express HTML, CSS, Angular, NoSQL, JavaScript, Node.js, Postman and MongoDB.
