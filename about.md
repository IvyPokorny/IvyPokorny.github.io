# Professional Assessment

## About Me
As a recent graduate, I'm excited to share my ePortfolio while actively seeking employment. This portfolio showcases my projects in software engineering, algorithms, data structures, database management, and security, reflecting my solid grasp of core computer science principles. Within it, you'll find evidence of my technical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and commitment to user-centered design. I emphasize my strengths in teamwork, communication, technical expertise, and adherence to security best practices, which position me to make a meaningful impact in the industry.

My journey through the Computer Science program has equipped me with a diverse skill set, preparing me to excel in the tech field. The projects I've completed illustrate my understanding and application of computer science principles. This ePortfolio not only highlights my technical competencies but also my dedication to professional growth and readiness to contribute to the industry.

## Strengths in Core Competencies
### Collaborative Environments and Teamwork
In the Computer Science program, I honed my ability to build collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to make informed decisions. For example, in my coursework, CS320 Software Development LifeCycles I regularly participated in peer reviews, and group discussions. I nearly every class I have participated in group discussions. In this course the narratives and code review were crucial in getting feedback into organizational decisions. Without the feedback from those assignments, the enhancments would likely have been insufficient or misalligned to the requirements. These experiences taught me how to effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, fostering mutual understanding and collaboration.

The iterative development process for Stock’t exemplifies this strength. During CS 360 where the artifact was originally created I incorporated user feedback from co-workers at a flower shop to refine the app's features, such as the low-stock alert system. The enhancments made during this course included graphing functionality. This iterative approach not only improved the app's usability but also demonstrated my ability to work collaboratively with end-users to meet their needs.

### Communication with Stakeholders
The ability to deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications is critical in the field of computer science. My ePortfolio highlights this strength through clear documentation, detailed narratives, and visual representations of technical concepts. For example, the implementation of an analytics dashboard in Stock’t is accompanied by user-friendly graphs and labels, making it easier for stakeholders to interpret inventory trends.

In conversation with the owner of the flower-shop I was also able to flesh out more features that she felt would be important in an inventory app. These added features showcase my ability to adapt communications to specific audiences, ensuring that technical solutions are accessible and actionable.

### Algorithm and Data Structures

### Inventory App: 
Utilizes data structures to efficiently manage inventory data, allowing quick access and updates for stock levels. Algorithms for tracking inventory changes are implemented to ensure timely notifications for low stock.
### 3D Graphics Class: 
Involves the use of complex algorithms to render realistic 3D objects and manipulate graphic data structures, enhancing the interactive experience.
### Smart Thermostat: 
Implements state machine algorithms for managing temperature control, optimizing performance through effective decision-making logic based on user input and environmental conditions.
### Pet Hotel Java: 
Uses object-oriented principles to create data structures representing pets, owners, and transactions, allowing for seamless operations such as intake and checkout.
### Travel Website: 
Employs algorithms for personalizing user experiences based on behavior data, ensuring the site dynamically adjusts to user preferences.

### Software Engineering and Databases

### Inventory App: 
Follows software engineering principles by emphasizing user-centered design and thorough testing, ensuring a reliable and functional application. The integration of a database for inventory management tracks stock dynamically.
### Smart Thermostat: 
Employs modular design principles, integrating various hardware and software components. It demonstrates effective database interaction by sending and retrieving temperature data from the fictional server SysTec.
### Pet Hotel Java: 
Focuses on backend development and database management, ensuring data integrity and smooth operation of critical processes through comprehensive testing and effective debugging.
### Travel Website: 
Covers the full software development lifecycle, emphasizing modularity and maintainability. The project reflects industry-standard methodologies to deliver a high-quality, scalable web application.

### Security Mindset

### Smart Thermostat: 
Incorporates considerations for secure communication between the device and the server, recognizing potential vulnerabilities in transmitting temperature data over Wi-Fi.
### Pet Hotel Java: 
Implements secure handling of user data and emphasizes rigorous testing to identify any security issues in processing sensitive pet and owner information.
### Travel Website: 
Adheres to secure coding practices by ensuring proper user authentication and data protection throughout the development lifecycle, addressing common web security concerns such as data breaches and user data integrity.

Overall, these projects not only demonstrate a practical application of technical competencies but also exemplify the importance of integrating algorithms, database management, and security considerations throughout the software development process. Each project contributes to a well-rounded skill set in these fundamental areas.
