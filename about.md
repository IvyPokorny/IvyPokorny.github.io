# Professional Assessment

My name is Ivy Pokorny, and as a recent graduate, I'm excited to share my ePortfolio while seeking employment. This portfolio showcases my projects in software engineering, algorithms, data structures, database management, and security, demonstrating my strong grasp of core computer science principles.

You'll find evidence of my technical skills, creative problem-solving, strengths in teamwork and communication, and commitment to user-centered design. My journey through the Computer Science program has equipped me with a diverse skill set, preparing me to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. This ePortfolio highlights not just my technical competencies, but also my dedication to professional growth and readiness to contribute.

## Strengths in Core Competencies
### Collaborative Environments and Teamwork
In the Computer Science program, I refined my skills in fostering collaborative environments that help diverse audiences make informed decisions. For instance, in CS320 Software Development LifeCycles, I regularly engaged in peer reviews and group discussions, where feedback on narratives and code was essential for aligning enhancements with requirements.

The iterative development process for the inventory app exemplifies this strength. In CS360, I incorporated user feedback from co-workers at a flower shop to refine app features, including adding graphing functionality and a low-stock alert system. This approach not only improved usability but also showcased my ability to collaborate effectively with end-users to meet their needs.

### Communication
Delivering professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications is essential in computer science. My ePortfolio demonstrates this strength through clear documentation, detailed narratives, and visual representations of technical concepts. For instance, the analytics dashboard in the inventory app includes user-friendly graphs and labels, making inventory trends easily interpretable for stakeholders.

In discussions with the flower shop owner, I identified additional features that she deemed important for the inventory app. These enhancements reflect my ability to tailor communications for specific audiences, ensuring that technical solutions are accessible and actionable.

### Core Competencies fulfilled

The projects I'll be showcasing in this ePortfolio demonstrate a range of competencies in algorithm design, data structures, software engineering, database management, and security considerations.

The Inventory App highlights efficient inventory management using advanced data structures and algorithms, allowing for quick access and timely notifications for low stock levels. This project adheres to software engineering principles, emphasizing user-centered design and thorough testing, supported by dynamic database integration for tracking stock.

In the 3D Graphics Class, I applied complex algorithms to render realistic 3D objects and manipulate graphic data structures, enhancing the interactive user experience.

The Smart Thermostat employs state machine algorithms for effective temperature control, optimizing performance through decision-making logic based on user input and environmental conditions. It illustrates modular design by integrating hardware and software while ensuring secure communication with the fictional server SysTec.

With Pet Hotel Java, I utilized object-oriented principles to create data structures for pets, owners, and transactions, ensuring seamless operations like intake and checkout. This project focuses on backend development and database management, emphasizing data integrity through rigorous testing and debugging, alongside secure handling of sensitive user information.

The Travel Website personalizes user experiences through algorithms that dynamically adjust based on behavior data. It covers the full software development lifecycle, highlighting modularity and industry-standard methodologies to deliver a high-quality, scalable application while adhering to secure coding practices to protect user data.

Together, these projects illustrate my comprehensive skill set and the importance of integrating algorithms, database management, and security considerations throughout the software development process.
